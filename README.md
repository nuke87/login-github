# login-github
My first project in C, a simple login system
//VERSION 1.0
First version of login.c was a simple "if else" instruction with a char variable and int variable.
//VERSION 1.0.1
The second version is a better one, with comparison of strings. One string for login-name and the other one is for password.


PASSWORD COMPARISON WITH A TEXT FILE
login_dat.c
Password comparison with a text file, at the moment it is possible just compare one character or on digit.
If the password is wrong, the programm create a log file with a error message.
